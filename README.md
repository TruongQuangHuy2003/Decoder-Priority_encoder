Decoder and priority encoder are fundamental digital circuits used
in various applications such as memory addressing, control systems and
data encoding. These circuits are designed to transform binary data into a
more useful or manageable form, helping streamline operations within
complex systems. A decoder takes a binary input and actives one or more
output lines, corresponding to the binary input, while a priority encoder
encodes multiple input lines into a smaller number of output lines,
prioritizing the highest active input.
In this report, we will delve deeper into the operation, types and
applications of both decoder and priority encoder, highlighting their
significance in modern digital systems
